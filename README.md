# BetterDo

**Welcome to the monorepo for BetterDo** — a fast, modern task manager designed to help you stay focused and organized.

I built BetterDo to simplify how I track tasks and manage projects — and I use it every day. Whether you're organizing your work, side projects, or personal goals, I hope it helps you as much as it helps me.

This project is powered by a modern tech stack — TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vite, and more — with a strong focus on developer experience. It’s easy to run locally, contribute to, and deploy in production.

[Launch the app](https://betterdo.app) to see it in action!

## 🚧 Active Migration

This project is currently being migrated from two separate repositories into a monorepo. The goal is to simplify the development process and make it easier to manage dependencies and releases.

See original repositories:

- [betterdo-api](https://github.com/brandon-pereira/betterdo-api)
- [betterdo-ui](https://github.com/brandon-pereira/betterdo-ui)

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (for managing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) versions)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
yarn install
```

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
yarn start
```

If everything was successful, you should be able to access the application at the following URLs:

- [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) is the API server
- [http://localhost:4001/](http://localhost:4001/) is the Web App server
- [http://localhost:4002/](http://localhost:4002/) is the public website (we recommend starting here)
