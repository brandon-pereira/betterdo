# BetterDo

**Welcome to the monorepo for BetterDo** ‚Äî a fast, modern task manager designed to help you stay focused and organized.

I built BetterDo to simplify how I track tasks and manage projects ‚Äî and I use it every day. Whether you're organizing your work, side projects, or personal goals, I hope it helps you as much as it helps me.

This project is powered by a modern tech stack ‚Äî TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vite, and more ‚Äî with a strong focus on developer experience. It‚Äôs easy to run locally, contribute to, and deploy in production.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (for managing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) versions)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
yarn install
cp api/.env.example api/.env
```

After copying the `.env` file, you should edit it to set your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference.

After setting your environment variables, you can run the development server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
yarn start
```

If everything was successful, you should be able to access the application at the following URLs:

- [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) is the API server
- [http://localhost:4001/](http://localhost:4001/) is the Web App server
- [http://localhost:4002/](http://localhost:4002/) is the public website (we recommend starting here)
